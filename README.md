QFSM (Quantitative Fluorescent Speckle Microscopy) is a MATLAB software for quantifying the rate of polymer assembly, disassembly and flow across the entire leading edge in constitutively motile cells from fluorescent speckle microscopy movies. It identifies and computationally tracks speckles and utilizes their location, appearance, and disappearance to derive network flows and assembly/disassembly maps.
